  @doc """
  Given a five letter answer and a five letter guess,
  provide a score with the following rules:
  - If the correct letter is in the correct position, return {letter, :green}
  - If the correct letter is in an incorrect position, return {letter, :yellow}
  - If a letter is incorrect, return {letter, :gray}
  - A letter can only participate in a score once. That is, if a user guesses
  - two "a" letters but the answer only has one "a",
    score the correct "a" as green and the incorrect one as "gray".
